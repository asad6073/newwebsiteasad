            <p>If you’ve started to learn to code and have decided to get serious — or you’re fresh out of school with no job experience — this is the perfect article for you.No one said coding was easy. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. If you can code on a basic level — congratulations! You are in a club with very few members.
            We’ve all had to face new roads and stay on them for the long haul. A senior developer is a junior developer who nevergaveup. A Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt is a white belt who never gave up.
            Embracing what you’re doing is difficult and very few can do it, and so enjoy and have fun with it!</p>
